<!-- !Explanation 
? script2.js is downloaded while the browser is still parsing the HTML.
? The script only executes after the entire HTML document is completely parsed, ensuring that the DOM is ready.
* Key Differences:
? async: The script is downloaded and executed as soon as possible, possibly before the DOM is fully loaded.
? defer: The script is downloaded in parallel but is executed only after the HTML parsing is complete.
* When to Use Which:
? Use async when the script is independent of the DOM (e.g., analytics scripts, advertisements).
? Use defer when the script depends on the DOM (e.g., DOM manipulation scripts, event listeners). -->
