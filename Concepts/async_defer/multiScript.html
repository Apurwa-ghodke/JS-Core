<!-- 
!Explanation
* When you have multiple scripts on a page:

? async scripts are executed as soon as they are downloaded, and the order of execution is not guaranteed.
? defer scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML, after the page has finished loading. 

? In this example: script1.js will download and execute as soon as possible,
 without waiting for the others or the HTML.  

? script2.js and script3.js will
 download in parallel but only execute after the DOM is fully parsed and in the
 order they appear.  -->
